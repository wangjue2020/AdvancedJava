Dear recruiter,
I am writing to apply for Software Developer at OneClass. Through the Indeed, I learned about this position. I believe my academic study and eighteen-month internship would make me an excellent candidate for the position.
As a fourth-year computer science student, I am aspiring to make some differences to the world after recognizing the changes brought by the revolution of technology. I know that OnClass is working hard on that way, which is the most important reason that I am keen to join OnClass to bring my strong technical skills and passion for the future work.
In my coursework the past year, I worked with a team to design software for a simple paint panel. My proficiency in the programming language Java allowed me to complete the coursework and some extra achievements for special features. We paid more attention to the user interface and tried the best to make the user interface clear and simple by using multiple design patterns to make our code.
In the summer of 2017, I had an internship in a company working on computer and network technology. At the beginning of the internship, I had no idea about front-end application. The manager asked me to learn html, css, and javascript by myself during the first week of the internship. After that, I independently completed tasks of making some websites according to the design of UI. This was an excellent experience to work with teammates, since I know team work plays an important role in the process of an application development. I believe these skills and experiences will be valuable to an staff at OnClass.
In my sixteen-month internship during 2018-2019, I worked in iAccess solution branch of Ministry of Education Ontario. I worked with the Serious Occurrence and Residential Licensing System project as a full stack developer. I learned how to transfer what I learned in university to the working environment.
I would like to have an opportunity to further discuss how my passion and skills can contribute to OnClass. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I am looking forward to meet you to discuss my suitability further.
Sincerely, Jue Wang
